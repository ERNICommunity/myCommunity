# myCommunity

This is a simple little app which will display all the upcoming community events so you have easy access via a smartphone or tablet.

Written using Xamarin.Forms. This is a project to learn about Xamarin.Forms, and anyone who knows a bit of C# and has a passion for lean mobile apps is welcome to join in.

Want to join in? Contact Angus or Jazz. Or if you think you know what you are doing then assign an issue/enhancement to yourself and get it done.

This is the current state of the app.


We got Wilbert to help us with some design. We're aiming for a look like this...
