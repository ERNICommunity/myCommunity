# myCommunity

This is a simple little app which will display all the upcoming community events so you have easy access via a smartphone or tablet.

Written using Xamarin.Forms. This is a project to learn about Xamarin.Forms, and anyone who knows a bit of C# and has a passion for making small, lean mobile apps is welcome to join in.

Want to join in? Contact Angus or Jazz.

This is the current state of the app.
